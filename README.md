# 🌳 Decision Tree Models

This repository contains implementations of Decision Tree models using Python and Scikit-Learn. It includes both classification and regression approaches.

## 📂 Contents

- **Decision Tree Classifier** 🏷️
  - ## Prepruning and postpruning Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Implements a classification model using Decision Trees.
  - Evaluates accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

- **Decision Tree Regressor** 📊
  - ## Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Implements a regression model using Decision Trees.
  - Analyzes model performance using metrics such as MSE and R².
